# TinyCommerce ðŸ›’
A modular mock e-commerce storefront built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ideal for strengthening UI fundamentals, cart logic, and client-side architecture.

## How to Use This App?

**Browse Products**
- Products are dynamically loaded from a mock JSON file.
- Click on a product name or image to visit its detail page.
  
**Search & Pagination**
- Use the search bar to filter products by name or description.
- Navigate between product pages using Previous/Next buttons (client-side pagination).
  
**Add to Cart**
- Click the + icon to add an item to your cart.
- Quantity management and total pricing are handled via localStorage.
  
**Manage Cart**
- Go to the Cart page to adjust quantities, view subtotals, or remove items.
- See real-time updates to item totals and the grand total.
  
**Checkout**
- The Checkout page displays a summary of your cart and a basic shipping form.
- Submitting the form simulates a completed order and clears the cart.
  
**Login**
- A basic form to simulate authentication. Username/password is not yet connected to any backend.
  
**Admin Panel**
- A form to create new products and preview a simple list â€” ideal for learning CRUD structures in future versions.
